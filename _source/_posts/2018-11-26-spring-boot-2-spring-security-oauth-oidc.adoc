Spring Boot is a Java framework that makes it possible to build applications quickly, with very little Java code. It ships with a number of starters and tools that allow you to create secure web applications in just a few lines of code.

[more intro - what keywords should we target? spring oauth2, spring oidc, spring boot oidc, spring security oauth, spring sso are some ideas]

== What's New in Spring Boot 2.1

== Create a Secure Spring Boot Application

You can create a Spring Boot application quickly with the Spring CLI. It allows you to write Groovy scripts that get rid of the boilerplate Java and build file configuration. This allows you, the developer, to focus on the necessary code. Refer to the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html#getting-started-installing-the-cli[project's documentation for installation instructions]. To install Spring CLI, I recommend using https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html#getting-started-sdkman-cli-installation[SDKMAN!]:

[source,bash]
----
sdk install springboot
----

Or you can use https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html#getting-started-homebrew-cli-installation[Homebrew] if you're on a Mac.

[source,bash]
----
brew tap pivotal/tap
brew install springboot
----

Create a `helloWorld.groovy` file that has the following code:

[source,groovy]
----
@Grab('spring-boot-starter-security')
@RestController
class Application {

  @RequestMapping('/')
  String home() {
    'Hello World'
  }
}
----

The `@Grab` annotation invokes [Grape](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/grape.html) to download dependencies. Because Spring Security is in the classpath, its default security rules will be used. That is, protect everything, allow a user with the username `user`, and generate a random password on startup for that user.

Run this app with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
spring run helloWorld.groovy
----

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and you'll be prompted to login with your browser's basic authentication dialog. Enter `user` for the username and copy/paste the generated password from your terminal. If you copied and pasted the password successfully, you'll see `Hello World` in your browser.

== Add Identity and Authentication with OIDC

Using the same username and password for all your users is silly. Since friends don't let friends write authentication, I'll show you how to use Okta for auth with just a few lines of code.

OIDC requires an identity provider (or IdP). There are many well-known IdPs like Google, Twitter, and Facebook, but those services don't allow you to manage your users like you would in Active Directory. Okta allows this, _and_ you can use Okta's API for OIDC.

=== Create an OIDC App in Okta

Log in to your Okta Developer account and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Web** and click **Next**. Give the app a name you'll remember, and specify `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta` as a Login redirect URI. Click **Done**. The result should look something like the screenshot below.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-boot-2.1/okta-oidc-app.png' %}[alt=Okta OIDC App,width=700,align=center]

Copy and paste the URI of your default authorization server, client ID, and the client secret into `application.yml` (you'll need to create this file).

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          okta:
            issuer-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
        registration:
          okta:
            client-id: {clientId}
            client-secret: {clientSecret}
----

Create a `helloOAuth.groovy` file that uses Spring Security and its OIDC support.

[source,groovy]
----
@Grab('spring-boot-starter-security')
@Grab('spring-security-oauth2-client')
@Grab('spring-security-oauth2-jose')

@RestController
class Application {

  @GetMapping('/')
  String home(java.security.Principal user) {
    'Hello ' + user.name
  }
}
----

Restart your Spring Boot app, and try to access `http://localhost:8080`. You'll be redirected to Okta to log in.

In the near future, you'll be able to use https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot[Okta's Spring Boot starter] and make it even simpler:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
    client-id: {clientId}
    client-secret: {clientSecret}
----

[source,groovy]
.helloWorld.groovy
----
@Grab('okta-spring-boot-starter')

@RestController
class Application {

  @GetMapping('/')
  String home(java.security.Principal user) {
    'Hello ' + user.name
  }
}
----
